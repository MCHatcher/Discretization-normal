# Discretization-normal
Discretization of a normal R.V.
This repository provides codes to approximate one or multiple IID-Normal processes, and generate simulated series, using the
% method in Adda and Cooper (2003, Dynamic Economics). Our approach follows the notes of Makoto Nakajima (https://makotonakajima.github.io/comp/).
